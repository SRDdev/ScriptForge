More specifically, in',\n","  'feature engineering, which is transforming raw',\n","  'data into high-quality input signals for ML models. But this process is often',\n","  \"inefficient and brittle. Well I'm Priyanka,\",\n","  'and in this video we will identify',\n","  'the key challenges with feature engineering, how',\n","  'Vertex Feature Store help solve them, and see a quick demo. Now what are the key',\n","  'challenges with ML features? The first is that they are',\n","  'hard to share and reuse across your different',\n","  'steps of the ML workflow and across projects, which',\n","  'results in duplicate efforts. Second is that it is hard to',\n","  'serve in production reliably with lower latency,',\n","  'and the third is that there is an',\n","  'inadvertent skew in feature values between',\n","  'training and serving, usually, which causes your model',\n","  'quality to degrade over time. That is exactly where Vertex',\n","  \"Feature Store comes in. It's a fully managed\",\n","  'and unified solution to share, discover,',\n","  'and serve machine learning features at scale',\n","  'across different teams within your organization. And it also helps',\n","  'reduce the time to build and deploy',\n","  'your AI ML applications by making it easy to',\n","  'manage and organize your ML features in one place. It makes the features reusable,',\n","  \"easy to serve, and avoids skew. Now let's see how to set it up. In the console, in Vertex\",\n","  \"AI, we see the Feature tab. To get started, let's\",\n","  'click on this documentation and explore, using',\n","  'Feature Store section. Now the first thing you',\n","  'need is a Feature Store. At the time of this',\n","  'recording, Feature Store is in preview so just',\n","  \"know that depending on when you're watching this,\",\n","  'there might be more options and updates that you would see. You cannot create a Feature',\n","  \"Store in the console, so let's use this sample\",\n","  'notebook to learn how to create it using the SDK. This sample uses a movie',\n","  'recommendations data set and the task',\n","  'is to train a model to predict if a user is',\n","  'going to watch a movie and serve this model online. We will learn to import our',\n","  'features into Feature Store, serve online prediction requests',\n","  'using the imported features, and then access imported',\n","  'features in offline jobs, such as training jobs. To set up, we install',\n","  'some additional packages, set up our project, and',\n","  'authenticate our Google Cloud account. Step one is to create',\n","  'data set for output. We are creating BigQuery data',\n","  'set to host the output data. Input the name of the',\n","  'data set and the table we want to store',\n","  'the output later. Then we are defining',\n","  \"constants and Feature Store-related imports. Here's how the Vertex\",\n","  'Feature Store actually works. It organizes the data with the',\n","  'three hierarchical concepts. Featurestore, which is the',\n","  'place to store your features-- EntityType, under Featurestore,',\n","  'describes an object to be modeled, real or',\n","  'virtual, and Feature itself, under EntityType, describes an',\n","  \"attribute of that EntityType. Now in our movie's\",\n","  'prediction example, we will create a featurestore',\n","  'called movie_prediction. This store has',\n","  \"two entity types-- Users and Movies. The user's entity\",\n","  'type has age, gender, and like genres features. The Movies entity type has',\n","  'the genre and average rating features. The first thing we do is',\n","  'to create the featurestore. The method to create',\n","  'a featurestore returns a long',\n","  'running operation that starts an asynchronous job. This may take about',\n","  'three minutes or so, and once the',\n","  'featurestore is created, we can see it in the console. And we can create our',\n","  \"entities in this store. I'm creating two entities here-- user and movies. We can also create features\",\n","  \"within these entities. Here I've created age,\",\n","  'gender, and like genres under user, and title,',\n","  'genres, and average rating under our movies. If we want, we',\n","  'can search through and filter on these features. Now we need to import feature',\n","  \"values before we can use them for online offline serving. Let's head back\",\n","  'into our notebook to see how to import features',\n","  'in bulk using the Python SDK. We define the data source, the',\n","  'BigQuery table or Cloud Storage bucket, and the destination',\n","  'featurestore, entity and the features to be imported. You do this for both users',\n","  'and the movies entities. Now for a latency-sensitive',\n","  'service such as online model prediction, we would need',\n","  'to serve our feature values online. For example, for',\n","  'a movie service, we might want to',\n","  'quickly show movies that the current user',\n","  'would most likely watch by using online predictions. You can read one',\n","  'entity per request or even read multiple',\n","  'entities per request. Now if you need feature',\n","  'values for high throughput, typically for training a',\n","  'model or batch prediction, then serving feature',\n","  'values in batch is a better idea',\n","  'than serving online. Consider this example-- if the',\n","  'task is to prepare a training data set to train a model which',\n","  'predicts if a given user will watch a given movie, then to',\n","  'achieve this we need two sets of inputs-- features, that we',\n","  'have already imported, and labels, which is the',\n","  'ground-truth data recorder that user X has watched',\n","  'movie Y. It also includes the time stamp which',\n","  'indicates when the ground-truth was actually observed. As labels and feature values',\n","  'are collected over time, those feature values change. The Feature Store can perform',\n","  'a point in time lookup so that you can',\n","  \"fetch the feature values at a particular time. It's literally the data\",\n","  'version of going back to a previous version of',\n","  'your source code in GitHub.
